# Hello-world

My first repository on Gethub

I have heard about Gethub for some time. However, I just started an account to see what it is like.
I have experience with HTML, C++, C#, SQL, C, Java, PHP, and Javascript. Without productions experience in these languages.
My favorite languages that I have the most experience with is C#, SQL, and HTML.
I can't say that I am proficient enought to call these languages my own. I plan to better myself here on this site.
